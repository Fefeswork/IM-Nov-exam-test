        <h2>Blog 1: Overview of Data-Visualisation</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
     Data visualization can be defined as the representation of information using charts, images graphs, diagrams, etc. It can further be described as telling the user a story by organizing data into a form that is easier to read and understand.
Before diving into what data visualization is and how it can relate to web development, we will first investigate what data is.
Data is defined as facts and or stats that have been collected when conducting research and are used for analysis and reference. According to the Li reading, data is defined as “raw, unprocessed information that is not recognized as having the meaning” (Li. 2020). Although the reading does give data a set definition, with the definition provided above we can gather that data is information that has been collected. The information collected does not necessarily have meaning until we give the data meaning. An example of data could be the ‘number of adults aged 20-23’, this information is meaningless unless we give it meaning by stating that ’19 adults aged 20-23 enjoy pasta’. Essentially “data can exist in any form usable or not” (Li, 2020, p.20).
There are two types of data: primary data and secondary data. In the reading, primary data is described as, “collected from the units or individual respondents directly for the purpose of certain study of information (Agarwal, 2006, p. 3)”. (Li, 2020, p.20) This relates to the previous example made about collecting data about the number of adults aged 20-23. Secondary data refers to “the information contained in the data, which is ‘used again from records, processed and statistically analysed to extract some information for other purpose’ “(Li, 2020, p.20). The secondary data per the previous example can be described as what is then shown (ie. the information being shown in a book or journal).
Having defined and understood what is meant by data we now investigate what it means to visualize the data at hand and what is meant by ‘data visualization’. Data visualization has many definitions. as per the Li article, Li states that most definitions of data visualization focus on the connection between data and computer technology to transform data into a visual form. Li then proceeds to list different definitions given by other researchers which show and back her statement that data visualization can be defined in many ways. In essence by combining and linking the different definitions of what data visualization is one can define it as: the representation and the presentation of information that has been absent in some quantified data in a graphic format.
In the context of web development, data visualization is the presentation of data through visual cues (ie. graphs, maps, or other visual media). Data visualization is used to help the user/audience understand the data that you are presenting to them. In essence, you are telling a story or giving the user an idea of what your website is entailing. There are many ways in which data can be visualized. Examples include tables, graphs, charts, scatter plots, or maps. These examples are considered a form of traditional data visualization (Li, 2020, p.21).
Now that we have defined and investigated what data visualization is we can now investigate why this could be seen as an important aspect when designing a website and how it may play a role in enhancing the user’s experience. An example of an advantage of data visualization is a better understanding of data. In the article, Li describes four advantages of data visualization these being: it has the ability to represent a vast amount of data straight away, it enables the viewer/audience to identify patterns in the data to formulate new ideas, and it can be used for product quality control and it enhances the understanding of large-scale and small-scale data.
Having some form of data visualization when developing a website could potentially enhance your user’s experience when they visit your site because not only will it give them insight on what product you have to offer, it makes it easier for them to read and understand whatever data you would like to share with them. For example, if you were to make a website about games you’ve played and/or reviewed it would help to have data displaying either which genre of games you’ve played, the number of games you’ve played within those genres, or the rating you have given the games based on your review in some form of chart or graph. If it were displayed in the text, it may overwhelm the user and seem too complicated to navigate.
Reflecting on the article, one can gather that we now understand why data and data visualization within the web development space is important. Li has provided insight on the advantages of data visualization and has also given forms of traditional data visualization where she explains each form giving insight on what data is well suited for a form of data visualization. This article relates well to web development because although it does not directly do so, it provides the developer with insight on how to provide the user/ audience with a great user experience when viewing their site and could help in terms of improving the user interface of their site.<br>
