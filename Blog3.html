        <h2>Blog 3: What is Interaction for Data-visualization</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Interaction refers to an action in which two or more people or objects influence one another.
                It also refers to communication or direct involvement with something or someone. Data 
                visualization can be defined as the representation of information using charts, images graphs, 
                diagrams, etc.
                In a previous article, Overview of Data Visualisation by Qi Li, Li gives us an overview of 
                what the term ‘data’ means. She also provides an overview of what data visualisation is and 
                discusses the uses for data visualisation in the context of web development. We further learn 
                the types of data visualisation and the benefits of data visualisation, which is to understand 
                the data that you’re presenting to the user/ audience. (Li, 2020: 21). 
                Now that we have a clear definition of what ‘interaction’ and ‘data visualisation’ mean we 
                now look into what interaction for data visualisation is and what it entails by referring to the 
                article What is Interaction for Data Visualisation? by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin. In
                their article, they describe interaction as fundamental to data visualisation (Dimara and Perin, 
                2020: 2). We are introduced to a new term HCI- Human-Computer Interaction. They refer to 
                an HCI review which summarises concepts that describe the causal relationships between 
                humans and computer visualisation (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 2), which is what the article
                explores. The aim of the article is to explore what is meant by interaction for visualisation as 
                it is seen as a broad topic.
                In section 3 of the article, Dimara and Perin begin to discuss the definitions of interaction for 
                visualisation. “Interaction has been identified as an overloaded [92] and elusive [36,74] term, 
                and it is challenging to find a solid definition of interaction” (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 3).
                This statement has some truth in it as it can sometimes be difficult, and it also depends on the 
                context in which you speak of interaction. With referral to 32 papers with a definition tag in 
                an attempt to define interaction implicitly and explicitly, these are some of the findings from 
                these papers; “the papers reveal a mandatory component of interactions namely: external and 
                internal entities, external and internal action” (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 3).
                Under the external entities, the entities describe are the user and the data where the user is a 
                human. These two things exist co-independently without factoring in an interaction between 
                them. Under external actions, interaction is described as a dialogue between the user and the
                visualisation system made of action-reaction pairs (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 4). It is 
                understood that one thing/component would commit the action and receive a reaction from
                the other. In this case, it would be the user performing the action or input on the visualisation
                system. In terms of internal actions, this refers to the interaction with a visualization system 
                that involves a cognitive act of the user, in essence a form of reasoning and analysis process 
                on the data.
                In subsection 3 (3.1.2) the article looks further into what interaction for visualisation can 
                involve. These are the following things that interaction for visualisation can involve: external
                physical objects such as a mouse, keyboard or pen. It may also include body movements, 
                speech or eye movement. It can involve users’ actions which can change the data, can create 
                new data representations (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 4). “Interaction for visualization is 
                characterized as a goal-oriented activity that contains semantics that is sequential,
                incremental, and iterative” (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 5), by this, it is mean that when 
                interacting with a visualisation system there is a goal that is needed to be achieved whether 
                it’s changing the data presented incrementally or sequentially, this, in turn, means that the 
                visualisation becomes iterative due to the interaction.
                Moving onto the HCI view on interaction, it extracts seven concepts of interaction these 
                being Dialogue- this is seen as interaction as a cycle of communication through channelled
                input and output from a computer, think of it as having a conversation with someone, you 
                bring up an atopic and converse over the said topic. Transmission- this is seen as the 
                transmission of information between the computer and the user. Control- this type of 
                interaction is seen as the minimisation of error, with control the interactions are continuous 
                and are defined through a system that has inputs, outputs, feedback etc. Tool use- the tools 
                that are used to allow users the ability to interact with the computer. Optimal behaviour, adaptive behaviour, enables the user or the visualisation system to adapt to the changes the 
                input brings forth., embodiment and experience. 
                Reflecting on the new information I’ve learned; the article has provided many outlooks on 
                what interaction for data visualisation is. The article tackled mainly interaction and different 
                types of interaction but in turn, related it back to how it affects data visualisation. I thought of 
                a few examples while reading the article, these examples involve cases in which the input/ 
                action of the user affects the way in which data is visualised: an example would be a quiz that 
                displays a different result/set of data based on how you’ve answered the questions or data 
                displaying differently based on the settings you’ve chosen.
